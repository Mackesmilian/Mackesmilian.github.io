        <h2><br>There isn't much to say. I like photography and working on cars.
            Photography is more work than hobby at this point, but I enjoy it a lot.
            I do wedding photography and press photography mainly, which means I get to
            meet really cool people, like Phil Collins for example.<br>Under examples you can see
            some of my work.<br><br>My main source of relaxation is working on my car. Funny enough, it's very
            similar to software development: You have an exact idea of what you want to do,
            yet during the work, you will constantly run into issues. It's about 10% actual work
            and 90% swearing at what you've done. <br>Just like writing code.</h2>
